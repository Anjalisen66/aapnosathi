            <p>
              The idea for this platform was born from a shared experienceâ€”navigating the challenges of adjusting to a new city as students. Our team, hailing from different backgrounds, vividly remembers the overwhelming process of finding a place to stay, figuring out the city's transportation system, and locating reliable local services.
            </p>
            <p>
              While some of us spent weeks hunting for affordable accommodations that were both safe and close to our campuses, others struggled with long commutes, missed buses, or confusing transit systems. Add to that the frustration of finding essential services like affordable eateries, laundry, and repair shops, and it became clear: students need a better solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              We realized that while cities offer endless opportunities, they often lack centralized resources tailored to students' needs. This gap inspired us to create a platform that simplifies the transition for students moving to a new city.
